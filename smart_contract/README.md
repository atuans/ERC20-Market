# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Node providers

- Basically, hosting smart contracts requires you to set up a node of the blockchain on which you want to host them
- This is what platforms like Infura and Alchemy aim to solve, In essence, they are node providers; i.e., they provide remote access to blockchain services so you donâ€™t have to run your own node.
